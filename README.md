This is effectively a fork of Simeon Platonov's [dcgan-facegenerator](https://github.com/platonovsimeon/dcgan-facegenerator). I changed the output of images during training slightly to improve resolution. I ran this in a colab notebook using a runtime on a data set of 1000s of flags. I think the [sample results](https://github.com/nicg6645/dcgan-facegenerator-flag-fork/blob/master/helsynky_sample14.jpg) are pretty cool and wanted to share what I had created.
