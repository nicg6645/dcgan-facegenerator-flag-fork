# helsynky_GAN
helsynky_GAN is a straightforward tool for exploring neural art. Using a database of over 19,000 real-world national, local and regional flags, the helsynky neural net tries to generate aesthetically-pleasing flags on the keras platform with tensorflow backend. Although far from perfect, this project served as an excellent introduction to creating neural art, and I wanted to share it for other to try out too. I'd recommend running using the colab link in the README unless you have GPU to spare. Very possibly buggy: contact me at nicolas.guglielmin@gmail.com with any issues/tips.
