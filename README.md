This is effectively a fork of Simeon Platonov's dcgan-facegenerator (https://github.com/platonovsimeon/dcgan-facegenerator). I changed the output of images during training slightly to improve resolution. I ran this in a colab notebook using a runtime on a data set of 1000s of flags (ie not faces). I think the sample results are pretty cool.
